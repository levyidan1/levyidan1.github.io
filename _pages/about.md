I'm a computer science MSc. student from the Technion. Previously worked as an algorithm engineer.

Interested in solving difficult problems which don't yet have a solution, mostly in the fields of algorithms, autonomous systems and quantum physics.
I enjoy designing system architectures and providing end to end solutions.

Currently researching for algorithms that can predict future atrial fibrilation sessions in patients by reading their ECG signals.

In my spare time, I also do web development and digital marketing for various businesses.
