I'm currently a computer science MSc. student from the Technion, engaged in the research field of deep learning, and use methods from this field to analyze 12-lead ECG images and classify heart diseases. The methods that we develop are embedded in a smartphone application developed by a group of students I lead. The application is intended for distribution for use by medical personnel. As part of my research, I guide engineers and other master's and bachelor's degree students in several projects. Our work involves clinical trials with doctors in hospitals and the processing of real-time data streams.

Interested in solving complex problems, mostly in the fields of algorithms and autonomous systems. I enjoy designing system architectures and providing end to end solutions.
My technical skills include proficiency in programming languages such as Python, and I am fluent in English.
Previously worked as an algorithm engineer and in addition provided web development and digital marketing services for various businesses.
